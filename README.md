# Netflix-Movie-Details-Modal-Clone
This project is an application that includes a Netflix-like modal design and functionality. When the user clicks on the button, a modal appears in the center of the screen and presents information or content to the user. The modal can be closed by clicking the close button or outside area.

You can create a modal similar to Netflix with this HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. A modal is an information window that opens in the center of the screen and attracts the user's attention. In this design, there is a background image in the header section, descriptive text and an action button in the content section. Modal is designed to both have an aesthetic appearance and facilitate user interactions.

- HTML: Creates the structure, defines modals and buttons.
- CSS: Used for the visuality of the modal (colors, sizing, shadows).
- JavaScript: Controls dynamic operations such as opening and closing the modal.

This example is an ideal starting point for modern user interface design.
